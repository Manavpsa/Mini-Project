# Mini-Project
Multiparameter Cardiovascular Risk Analysis System

Involved the extraction of different Cardiovascular parameters using PPG signal obtained from the fingertip to assess the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Leveraged the Arduino UNO microcontroller and C++ programming to interface with PPG sensors and capture real-time data. Applied signal processing techniques in Python to analyze PPG signals and extract key cardiovascular parameters. Collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to ensure the project's success and alignment with healthcare objectives.
